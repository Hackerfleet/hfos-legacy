Primer
======
Since our platform is geared for running without a live connection to the
internet, we have to supply a lot of redistributables with our product.

We absolutely do not intend to claim other great people's work, so here is a
complete list of our used redistributable assets.  Should something be
missing, inappropriate or plainly wrong, contact the developers via
hfos@hackerfleet.org
