Layers
======

Baselayers
----------

HFOS' Map offers a good selection of open/free map sources like

  * OpenSeaMap - general nautical charts
  * OpenStreetMap - general land based maps
  * OpenWeatherLayers - current global weather situation
  * ESRI Satellite - Imagery of planet Earth
  * OpenFireMap - Emergency measures in cases of fire

and other useful data.


LayerGroups
-----------

You can configure selected layers as a reusable layergroup and store
their configuration as well.

Layergroups are associated to your account and can be shared with the crew.

They are associated with MapViews, so an already configured MapView always loads up with the
correct LayerGroup.
