        <h1>Map Utilities</h1>

        <p>This tool allows to upload raster charts and to rescan for already converted map data, that got lost e.g. due
            to a database upgrade</p>

        <form>
            <h3>Upload new chart</h3>
            <p>The system currently only accepts BSB/KAP files. Please upload a single .kap file to convert it to a HFOS
                layer.</p>
            <input class="form-control" type="file" name="uploadfile" id="filename">
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-default" ng-click="$ctrl.upload()">Upload Map</button>
            <hr>
            <h3>Rescan existing layers</h3>
            <p>The rescan action triggers an analysis of all stored HFOS layer caches and integrates them into the GDAL
                layer group.</p>
            <button type="submit" class="btn btn-danger" ng-click="$ctrl.rescan()">Rescan</button>
